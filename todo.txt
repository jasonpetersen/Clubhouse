Password protection:

So apparently if we're running on an Apache web server we can do the .htaccess thing to password-protect a directory (allowing free access to any files in that directory), and the password file automatically comes with (probably low level) encryption.
This isn't necessarily the most secure system, but it can prevent people from randomly going to other parts of the site.
